# Mental Health Risk Detection from Social Media Text

## Problem Statement

Mental health issues like depression and anxiety are widespread but difficult to detect early. Traditional screening relies on self-reporting or clinical visits, which many avoid due to stigma. Social media platforms contain rich user-generated content where people openly discuss struggles, but this data remains underutilized for proactive mental health risk detection.

## Project Approach

This project builds an automated system to identify potential mental health risks from Reddit text data by:

1. **Data Collection & Processing**: Extracting and cleaning Reddit posts from mental health-related subreddits
2. **Risk Classification**: Using NLP and machine learning to classify text for mental health risk indicators
3. **Interpretable Results**: Creating explainable models that highlight risky phrases and provide transparent predictions
4. **Interactive Application**: Developing a user-friendly dashboard/API for real-time risk assessment

The goal is to create an ethical, reproducible pipeline that bridges the gap between research and practical mental health support tools while respecting privacy boundaries.

## Dataset

Currently working with ADHD-related Reddit comments as a starting point for model development and validation.
